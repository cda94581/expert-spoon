Silent Syndicate Emoji Pack [RP]
Emojis up-to-date as of February 20, 2022
Best Supported by Minecraft 1.18.10
Version 2022.2.20
---
The Silent Syndicate Emoji Pack adds custom emojis from the Silent Syndicate Discord Server (discord.gg/silentwisperer).

NOTE
The resource pack only adds the emojis. This does NOT add any chat replacement filters for the emojis (typing :FrogThink: will not replace with the proper emoji). The behavior pack can do this. Refer to the behavior pack's README.txt file for mor information. Using only the resource pack, you must manually copy/paste each emoji.

HOW IT WORKS
Minecraft: Bedrock Edition contains a custom emoji system.
Ever notice the minecoin icon while in the marketplace? That's an emoji.
Playing on console? The "Press ___ to open chat" message contains an emoji.
Minecraft translates certain images into a unicode character. In other locations, this unicode character may appear as a box or any other symbol for "unknown character". This is normal, as Minecraft's emojis are not using existing unicode characters.
The vanilla emojis are stored in the "font" folder. Each file is named "glyph_##.png", replacing the "##" with a hexadecimal number ("00" (0) to "FF" (255)). The size of the image file is typically 128x128 or 256x256, and should allow the file to be divided into a 16x16 grid, where dimensions are powers of 2. Therefore, each file contains up to 16 x 16 = 256 emojis.
These files can be edited to modify or "add" emojis to the game. The most common files to be modified are "glyph_E0.png" and "glyph_E1.png", as these contain few vanilla emojis and allow space for custom ones.
Without going into too much detail as to how (as that's another ramble), Silent Syndicate Emoji Pack's custom emojis are downloaded and slotted into their own 16x16 slot of the "glyph_E1.png" file, and assigned a unicode character by Minecraft (0xE1##, e.g. 0xE108 for "AngryJamontoast").
